This is not the usual blah blah blah but fact. Kicksecure is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. Kicksecure is free of charge. Kicksecure is a derivative of Debian GNU/Linux. Kicksecure is produced independently of, with no guarantee from, The Tor Project. Kicksecure is created by volunteers in their spare time. Kicksecure was created by self-taught hobbyists in their spare time, without the backing of any particular formal certification or training. Although Kicksecure attempts to be as usable as possible, there are many ways in which it fails. Kicksecure is in English. Do not use Kicksecure without excellent knowledge of the English language. Misunderstandings have consequences. Kicksecure is based on other software, including GNU/Linux, Debian, and virtualization. Do not rely on Kicksecure without working knowledge of these technologies.

The documentation available on Kicksecure.com is a crash course in anonymity, privacy, and security on the Internet. Kicksecure is a technological means to anonymity, but staying anonymous is not just a technological problem: No tool is enough to keep you safe. Anonymity is a complex problem without an easy solution, and security is only as strong as its weakest link, often the user. The more you know, the safer you can be.
